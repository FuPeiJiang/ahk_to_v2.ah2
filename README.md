here's how I work: I take a script to convert,<br>
instead of converting functions (because that's boring)<br>
I just finished RunCMD.ahk and now I have no script to convert<br>

converted scripts:
* !get colour_mid.ahk
* Accelerated Scrolling 1.3.ahk
* RunAsTask.ahk
* RunCMD.ahk (`IsFunc()`, `Func()`, cannot be converted)

if you want to test it, find `AHK_parse(A_Clipboard)` inside bruh.ah2, run script, first the parse tree, then the ahkv2 will be put in your clipboard

___
(if I'm gonna move on, at least post this before moving on)

___
I plan for this to get issues over time
